    heat-keystone-setup : fix error on folsom first-install
    
    When running heat-keystone-setup for the first time after (re)installing
    openstack folsom, it fails, because the user-role-list is running *as* the
    heat user, not reading the roles assigned to the heat user, which fails
    because on a new install the heat user does not have the admin role.
    Using the credentials from the environment means we run the command as
    admin, but --user_id selects the roles for the heat user.
