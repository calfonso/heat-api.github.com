    Move client connection out of resources.py.
    
    Client connection references are currently cached at the resource instance
    level, which doesn't seem very useful.
    
    This change moves the client connection and caching to clients.py, then puts a
    Clients instance in a Stack. This means that (for example) all requests to nova
    in one stack will come from the same client instance.
