21:14:06 <sdake> hai guys
21:14:13 <shadower> sdake: wanna discuss it now or after the meet?
21:14:19 <sdake> during meeting we can discuss
21:14:26 <shadower> aight
21:14:45 <asalkeld> say I'll have to multitask (get kids up and attend meeting today)
21:15:01 <sdake> agenda topics rollcall, incubation application review, roadmap
21:15:06 <sdake> any others?
21:15:43 <asalkeld> sounds ok
21:16:05 <shadower> yeah
21:16:13 <shardy> sounds good
21:16:17 <sdake> #topic rollcall
21:16:19 <sdake> sdake here
21:16:23 <shardy> shardy here
21:16:26 <zaneb> present
21:16:28 <jpeeler> here
21:16:31 <shadower> here
21:16:38 <asalkeld> here
21:16:46 <Slower> here
21:17:01 <sdake> i think thats all the devs
21:17:06 <sdake> #topic incubation application review
21:17:29 <sdake> ok so put together an application based upon what we have on our wiki web pages email lists etc
21:17:53 <sdake> #link http://wiki.openstack.org/Heat
21:18:15 <asalkeld> is it not worth writing a non-aws rest api first?
21:18:23 <asalkeld> should be quick
21:18:40 <asalkeld> make it more likely to succeed
21:18:45 <sdake> here is what i'm thinking
21:19:10 <sdake> we post message with our application, indicating we would like people to take a look, and request a meeting to review the app at the start of G
21:19:33 <asalkeld> ok
21:19:39 <sdake> a few months time - in the meantime openstack devs know we are actively interested
21:19:42 <asalkeld> then keep working
21:19:59 <sdake> and can give us some opportunity to make modifications such as what you just mentioned
21:20:00 <Slower> that sounds good to me
21:20:15 <asalkeld> yip
21:20:29 <sdake> for the current app, anyone want me to make any changes?
21:20:29 <shardy> asalkeld: not sure I understand, why do we need two API implementations?
21:20:55 <zaneb> shardy: our current implementation is RPC only
21:20:55 <asalkeld> cos core openstack projects need a non-aws api
21:21:09 <shardy> Ah, ok, gotcha
21:21:57 <sdake> reason for waiting until g, ceilometer just went through incubation request, an dthey were asked to hold their request until the start of g
21:21:58 <Slower> so a second wsgi interface?
21:22:07 <sdake> (they have about 3 months of dev  time too)
21:22:11 <asalkeld> Slower, yar
21:22:26 <asalkeld> like nova
21:22:37 <shadower> asalkeld: proper rest? We say REST on the application but the AWS api is nothing but
21:22:41 <Slower> I wasn't sure we'd need that since the api is pretty umm.. simple and stablish?
21:22:53 <asalkeld> shadower, exactly
21:22:54 <Slower> we just going to make a prettier one?
21:23:09 <asalkeld> ya, not a big deal
21:23:18 <sdake> we can discuss during roadmap ;)
21:23:24 <sdake> everyone satisified wit hthe current app?
21:23:36 <asalkeld> looks good to me
21:23:39 <shadower> me too
21:23:43 <sdake> please vote +1 -1
21:23:45 <sdake> sdake +1
21:23:46 <shadower> +1
21:23:48 <jpeeler> +1
21:23:48 <shardy> +1
21:23:50 <zaneb> +1
21:23:53 <asalkeld> +1
21:24:03 <zaneb> dependencies appear to be listed as Fedora package names?
21:24:12 <sdake> dont like?
21:24:19 <zaneb> just wondering about that a little
21:24:20 <Slower> +1
21:24:28 <sdake> anyone can edit the wiki ;)
21:24:31 <sdake> feel free to change
21:24:37 <sdake> i wanted to make it clear they were python libs
21:24:40 <sdake> but maybe that is obvious
21:25:01 <zaneb> true, fair enough
21:25:13 <asalkeld> argubly we should not use our mailing list and use the openstack ml
21:25:25 <zaneb> just don't want to create the impression that we are Fedora-centric
21:25:39 <sdake> zaneb can you alter to pypi names?
21:25:43 <shadower> +1
21:25:47 <zaneb> sdake: sure
21:26:12 <sdake> sounds like new topic re ml
21:26:20 <sdake> #topic use os ml for heat discussions
21:26:30 <sdake> angus had brought this up before
21:26:35 <sdake> our mailing list is really low volume
21:26:45 <sdake> so it probably wouldn't be annoying
21:26:55 <zaneb> there is also openstack-dev now
21:26:57 <sdake> but typically projects have mailing lists separate on launchpad
21:26:58 <asalkeld> this to be seen as more active in the openstack community
21:27:25 <asalkeld> rather than all seperate
21:27:26 <zaneb> which imo makes it a bit more practical
21:27:44 <sdake> which argument is more practical zane :)
21:27:46 <zaneb> (wouldn't have to have development discussions on the main openstack list)
21:28:16 <asalkeld> ya - there is a new dev list
21:28:23 <Slower> personally I like the low volume list for dev discussions, but it would be good to get more visibility..
21:28:26 <Slower> dunno
21:28:26 <sdake> what about users, use user list?
21:28:42 <zaneb> for user-facing stuff, use main openstack list
21:28:46 <asalkeld> I surpose
21:28:50 <zaneb> for developer-only stuff, use openstack-dev
21:29:04 <asalkeld> the point is to totally integrate
21:29:13 <asalkeld> ourselves into openstack
21:29:18 <sdake> ok so roughly proposal is as follows:
21:29:20 <zaneb> then we are engaged with community but not spamming users
21:29:41 <asalkeld> yip
21:29:42 <sdake> 1) use openstack mailing list for heat user discussions, 2) use openstack-dev mailing list for heat dev discussions
21:29:51 <sdake> vote +1 / -1 on proposal
21:29:51 <jpeeler> can anybody use these mailing lists for their project or is this an incubation blessing?
21:29:59 <asalkeld> +1
21:30:10 <jpeeler> +1
21:30:16 <sdake> i think if we are annoying ppl they will tell us to gtfo ;)
21:30:17 <zaneb> jpeeler: ceilometer appear to be using the main list
21:30:21 <zaneb> +1
21:30:26 <shardy> +1
21:30:29 <shadower> +1
21:30:49 <sdake> well i'm torn, but the majority has i t :)
21:31:07 <sdake> sec forgot some agreeds
21:31:07 <asalkeld> sdake, why torn
21:31:25 <sdake> worry about lost messages
21:31:31 <sdake> ppl have to be more vigilient
21:31:34 <sdake> which is probably a good idea
21:32:03 <jpeeler> so when is this transition supposed to occur?
21:32:10 <sdake> #agreed application approved by devs, going to propose to PPB to review at start of G
21:32:12 * Slower is torn also
21:32:13 <Slower> :)
21:32:17 <asalkeld> openstack ml not so busy
21:32:38 <sdake> #agreed use openstack/openstack-dev ml for heat discussions
21:32:45 <zaneb> asalkeld: 3078 unread messages ;)
21:32:54 <sdake> mark all read ftw
21:33:01 <asalkeld> that's cos you don't read them
21:33:10 <sdake> that is only reason i am torn, that people dont read the list
21:33:23 <sdake> but if ppl read their lists, then wfm ;)
21:33:51 <asalkeld> they are less likely to read ours
21:34:00 <shadower> yeah
21:34:00 <asalkeld> ml that is
21:34:25 <sdake> #topic roadmap
21:34:52 <sdake> been busy pulling in common changes
21:35:11 <sdake> requires a bit of rework of our config system
21:35:44 <asalkeld> I am fixing a clusting bug atm:I(
21:35:53 <asalkeld> I am fixing a clustering bug atm:I(
21:36:03 <sdake> asalkeld working on ipc until he is dead.. ;)
21:36:26 <shardy> I've been looking at implementing the AWS Cloudwatch API, although is that still a priority if we're now talking alternate openstack-centric API's?
21:37:09 <sdake> i think idea is we do a rest specific api
21:37:25 <sdake> and provide a converter that converts cloudformatoin/cloudwatch into the rest specific api
21:37:40 <shardy> later, after we have aws parity, or build aws on top of the rest api?
21:37:57 <shardy> I've been purely focussed on aws parity, perhaps that is a mistake..
21:38:04 <sdake> i dont think that is a mistake
21:38:05 <zaneb> I don't see the point of adding another layer for the AWS path?
21:38:17 <asalkeld> I think have both side by side
21:38:50 <sdake> probably a good topic for openstack ml
21:39:13 <sdake> i have talked to a  few people prefer  to see one on top of another
21:39:16 <sdake> rather then side by side
21:39:32 <sdake> haven't heard feedback to make side by side although it is alot simpler to implement that way
21:39:53 <asalkeld> simple is good?
21:39:55 <zaneb> we still need a stable python (RPC) API, right?
21:40:04 <sdake> yup
21:40:09 <sdake> and yup
21:40:29 <zaneb> can't see a reason not to layer both HTTP APIs right on top of that then
21:40:31 <sdake> well before we crank out a bunch of work lets get some bikeshedding done on the ml
21:40:57 <Slower> +1 on ml
21:41:14 <shardy> yeah, I think we need to understand the requirements first
21:41:48 <sdake> well there are two ways to proceed, do it the way we think makes sense, and then potentially redo, or ask and get a 50/50 split and do it one way and have other half people unhappy :)
21:41:54 <sdake> -1/-1 :)
21:42:07 <zaneb> easier to get forgiveness than permission ;)
21:42:16 <sdake> zaneb the voice of reason
21:42:20 <asalkeld> +1 zaneb
21:42:45 <sdake> what state is autoscaling in asalkeld
21:43:11 <asalkeld> not quite done
21:43:18 <asalkeld> still needs work
21:43:27 <sdake> 27th is our next release milestone
21:43:42 <sdake> ie: 2 weeks
21:43:54 <asalkeld> ok, I'll need to see what needs to be done
21:44:03 <asalkeld> might be ok
21:44:26 <asalkeld> for basic functionality
21:44:29 <sdake> shardy think aws boto be ready to roll by 27th?
21:44:42 <shardy> sdake: I think it's ready now (or 99% there)
21:44:47 <sdake> cool
21:44:51 <sdake> well hit the other 1%
21:45:02 <shardy> gated on upstream
21:45:12 <shardy> they are not very responsive
21:45:40 <zaneb> seems like the dude has been away
21:46:00 <zaneb> he appeared to be very active on Twitter and stuff a couple of months ago
21:46:15 <shardy> zaneb: ah, cool, hopefully only a temporary delay then
21:46:27 <zaneb> fingers crossed
21:46:43 <sdake> zaneb beyond refactoring the whole codebase you have anything planned for v5 :)
21:46:53 <zaneb> lol
21:47:01 <zaneb> looking at the integration tests now
21:47:02 <sdake> angus made me do it
21:47:17 <sdake> speaking of integration tests, had discussion with jay pipes regarding tempeset
21:47:22 <sdake> which is a functional testing system for openstack
21:47:28 <sdake> might make sense to just integrate there
21:47:45 <sdake> can you investigate that?
21:47:49 <zaneb> yeah, would be interesting to know more about that
21:48:00 <zaneb> sure
21:48:00 <sdake> thats the I in investigate ;)
21:48:24 <sdake> jpeeler you have anything planned for v5
21:48:46 <zaneb> #action zaneb investigate functional testing with tempest
21:49:00 <sdake> #action zaneb investigate function testing with tempest
21:49:13 <sdake> #chair zaneb asalkeld jpeeler shadower slower shardy
21:49:13 <mheat-bot> Current chairs: asalkeld jpeeler sdake shadower shardy slower zaneb
21:49:20 <zaneb> ta
21:49:25 <jpeeler> sdake: just trying to get the packing stuff fully completed
21:49:38 <sdake> which packing stuff?
21:49:59 <jpeeler> sorry packaging. rpm accepted, deb stuff, and necessary ppas
21:50:18 <sdake> oh right, nice work there, jpeeler has done a nice job getting started as a packager in fedora folks
21:50:28 <sdake> so he will be submitting fedora packages for f18
21:51:01 <sdake> after he does initial package, each of us devs who takes on the release manager role will rebuild for rawhide/f18/ppas ;)
21:51:27 <sdake> jpeeler prob need some rawhide/ppa docs
21:51:48 <sdake> like wiki page or wiki improvements to release page
21:51:53 <jpeeler> of course
21:51:57 <sdake> cool
21:52:05 <sdake> slower got anything cooking for v5
21:52:16 <Slower> working on the per tenant stack stuff
21:52:26 <Slower> putting in the policy json stuff now
21:52:28 <sdake> 2 weeks enough?
21:52:32 <Slower> which seems to be the way to go
21:52:41 <Slower> well I hope so :)
21:52:46 <Slower> should do I think
21:52:49 <sdake> cool
21:52:59 <sdake> shadower got anything planned for v5?
21:53:08 <shadower> started looking into RDS
21:53:18 <sdake> cool that will be a sweet feature
21:53:19 <shadower> too early to say how much will get in but at least POC for sure
21:53:21 <sdake> plus more integration
21:53:26 <shadower> yeah
21:53:37 <sdake> i'm going to wrap up this common merge
21:53:42 <sdake> and do some refactor to deal with it
21:53:57 <sdake> and pump up our ubuntu template examples
21:54:08 <sdake> would like template parity for ubuntu and fedora
21:54:09 <Slower> sdake: nice :)
21:54:35 <sdake> unfortunatey sick last week and vacation week before so my contribution to v5 wont be as significant as rest of team - more next cycle ;)
21:54:49 <shardy> Is/has anyone else looked at getting UpdateStack working?
21:54:54 <sdake> as far as next cycle goes..
21:55:04 <shardy> was thinking of looking at that after cloudwatch
21:55:40 <sdake> updatestack is pretty important, worth doing
21:55:52 <asalkeld> yes
21:56:04 <shardy> should I look at that before the cloudwatch api (ie this week?)
21:56:17 <asalkeld> I think so
21:56:19 <sdake> yes from me
21:56:46 <shardy> k, cool - I have a good handle on cloudwatch for later now anyway, will start on update tomorrow
21:56:56 <sdake> nice
21:57:19 <sdake> well folks our next big chunk of work to tackle is either API rework or VPC
21:57:37 <sdake> so start thinking about that for our next cycle
21:58:13 <sdake> i'd like to start around 1st or 2nd v6, so try to wrap up feature dev and docs for v5 by 27th to give time for releasing
21:59:00 <zaneb> btw I am away from 25th to 8th
21:59:09 <zaneb> so y'all will be safe from refactoring ;)
21:59:19 <sdake> #action zaneb get some good r&r 25th-8th and not a moment longer ;)
21:59:43 <sdake> #topic open issues
22:00:02 <sdake> anyone have any open issues to discuss?
22:00:31 <shadower> sdake: the #55 we talked about earlier?
22:00:41 <sdake> sure
22:00:48 <sdake> so eventlet was changed?
22:00:52 <sdake> and this resulted in a different wsgi?
22:00:56 <shadower> yeah
22:01:03 <shadower> we're using paste's wsgi for now
22:01:17 <shadower> I could prod the eventled devs to make a release
22:01:21 <shadower> they're not very active tho
22:01:32 <sdake> poke em see what happens
22:01:43 <shadower> yeah
22:02:00 <sdake> any feedback on heat-jeos from community?
22:02:17 <shadower> ppetit liked the new ui
22:02:23 <sdake> nice
22:02:29 <asalkeld> it  is nice
22:02:31 <sdake> well if he is satisified, must be good ;)
22:02:36 <shadower> hehe
22:02:51 <shardy> I'm going to an openstack meetup in London next week - does anyone (asalkeld?) have any "intro to heat" slides?
22:03:07 <sdake> i am making a deck
22:03:08 <asalkeld> shardy, I'll send you my stuff
22:03:17 <asalkeld> I ran a demo too
22:03:20 <sdake> asalkeld send me your deck too
22:03:33 <sdake> i am presenting in aug at cloudopen on heat
22:03:40 <Slower> pmyers just sent out an email essentially asking all rh devs to be involved in both projects..
22:03:43 <shardy> asalkeld: thanks, it will only be a 5min talk (if at all), but any info appreciated
22:03:44 <sdake> going to do live demo of autoscale and ha
22:03:44 <Slower> openstack & heat
22:03:46 <Slower> or at least look
22:03:50 * sdake glutton for punishment
22:04:23 <asalkeld> ya
22:04:33 <sdake> shardy hit up russellb - he did lightning talk previously at openstack's summit
22:04:44 <sdake> he had 5 min timer
22:05:10 <shardy> sdake: OK, cool - I volunteered to do a Lignting talk this time, could do more at future meets
22:05:29 <sdake> ya - ideally we would have a standard deck + demo
22:05:37 <sdake> which should come outof cloudopen
22:05:51 <shardy> cloudopen?
22:05:59 <asalkeld> rain?
22:06:00 <sdake> conference in US in aug
22:06:09 <pmyers> it's along with LinuxCon in San Diego
22:06:16 <shardy> ah
22:06:24 * shardy hadn't heard about that yet
22:06:34 <sdake> there be dragons in the channel ;)
22:06:45 <pmyers> this is first year that CloudOpen is happening
22:06:53 <pmyers> they're trying to make LinuxCon.... cloudier :)
22:06:59 <sdake> should be good conference lots of good speakers
22:07:27 <asalkeld> ok, I am off to next meeting
22:07:32 <asalkeld> later guys
22:07:34 <sdake> poor asalkeld
22:07:42 <sdake> ok guys, if nothing else i'll end meeting
22:08:23 <sdake> nothing heard - remember we voted to take our conversations upstream - i'll notify the mailing list
22:08:30 <sdake> #endmeeting
