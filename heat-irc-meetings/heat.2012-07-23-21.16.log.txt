21:19:24 <zaneb> awake ;)
21:19:32 <sdake> #info zaneb awakens
21:19:54 <sdake> #topic status of feature dev
21:20:16 <sdake> jpeeler can you give us a quick update on fedora feature request
21:20:26 <jpeeler> yes
21:20:54 <jpeeler> spec files are *perfect* ;) and heat has been accepted as a feature for f18
21:22:03 <sdake> #link https://fedorahosted.org/fesco/ticket/909#comment:2
21:22:15 <sdake> looks like fesco approved, but doesnt like python-crypto
21:22:50 <sdake> what was reasoning for python crypto problems jeff?
21:23:37 <jpeeler> there were some security concerns for one thing. the default configuration is not ideal when using python-crypto
21:23:58 <jpeeler> i believe also the API wasn't very clean
21:24:26 <sdake> #info fesco approved heat as a fedora 18 feature, with suggestion to find an alternate dep for python-crypto
21:24:55 <sdake> can you look into the requirement for that dep?
21:25:14 <jpeeler> yes, i will look into expunging it if possible
21:25:19 <sdake> cool
21:25:29 <sdake> #action jpeeler to look into expunging python-crypto if possible
21:25:39 <sdake> did you have the meeting minutes handy for the fesco meeting?
21:25:59 <jpeeler> #link http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/2012-07-23/fesco.2012-07-23-17.01.log.html

21:26:27 <mheat-bot> Current chairs: asalkeld jpeeler sdake shadower shardy slower zaneb
21:26:34 <sdake> try link again jpeeler pls
21:26:40 <jpeeler> #link http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-meeting/2012-07-23/fesco.2012-07-23-17.01.log.html
21:26:44 <sdake> cool
21:26:54 <sdake> anyone have any other questions for jeff?
21:27:11 <asalkeld> no, well done jeff
21:27:21 <sdake> agree nice work jpeeler
21:27:26 <sdake> now for review and victory ;)
21:27:34 <sdake> shadower want to speak about rds?
21:27:41 <shadower> yeah
21:28:00 <shadower> the initial implementation just landed in master (thanks zaneb for the review)
21:28:11 <shadower> it's working and there's a template that shows it off
21:28:39 <shadower> it's not complete yet -- the big missing things are multiple availability zones and backup
21:28:53 <shadower> and multiple database engines
21:29:02 <shadower> AWS supports oracle and sql server
21:29:02 <sdake> right now just mysql?
21:29:04 <shadower> ya
21:29:22 <shadower> not sure what we can to do about the other two
21:29:32 <asalkeld> so not using reddarf_lite?
21:30:00 <asalkeld> just curious
21:30:13 <shadower> huh
21:30:20 <shadower> wasn't aware of it
21:30:21 <asalkeld> https://github.com/hpcloud/reddwarf_lite
21:30:25 <asalkeld> ok
21:30:27 <zaneb> asalkeld: I think that is a more long-term project
21:30:40 <asalkeld> no worries
21:30:47 <shadower> asalkeld: the readme is a bit nondescript
21:30:48 <asalkeld> less deps
21:30:49 <sdake> #info rds nested stack implementation functional - only mysql support - no avail zones or backup
21:30:49 <shadower> what is it?
21:31:07 <asalkeld> db as a service
21:31:16 <zaneb> shadower: it's an OpenStack DB service
21:31:20 <shadower> aah
21:31:47 <asalkeld> but don't worry, nice the way you did it
21:31:48 <sdake> seems like mysql dictated by cloudformation
21:32:05 <asalkeld> could add postgres
21:32:11 <shadower> yeah
21:32:40 <zaneb> this way is actually closer to AWS
21:32:47 <sdake> agree with zaneb
21:32:48 <zaneb> RedDwarf claim they're faster
21:33:02 <zaneb> it's an interesting project
21:33:12 <sdake> yup have to watch it and see where it heads
21:33:15 <zaneb> but good to have something going now
21:33:45 <sdake> zaneb any update on integration tests
21:34:16 <zaneb> yeah: downloading Fedora ISOs is really slow ;)
21:34:27 <zaneb> will cache them on one of those lab machines
21:34:36 <sdake> sounds good
21:34:45 <zaneb> but it's almost there
21:34:51 <sdake> #link https://github.com/heat-api/heat-integration-tests
21:34:58 <zaneb> so we will be able to provision a machine and run the test from a script
21:34:58 <sdake> new repo for our integration scriptlets
21:36:03 <sdake> after you wrap up, can jpeeler add heatjeos integration tests?
21:36:59 <jpeeler> i checked with zane earlier and he said i probably could now, but i rather just wait unless there is time pressure
21:37:18 <sdake> sooner better but whatevery ou feel comfortable with
21:37:45 <sdake> #action jpeeler to add integration tests for heat_jeos to heat-integration-tests repo
21:38:01 <sdake> any other topics zaneb?
21:38:11 <sdake> probably trying to tidy up before pto ;)
21:38:20 <zaneb> yeah, exactly
21:38:25 <sdake> cool
21:38:34 <sdake> slower any updates on tenant auth
21:38:57 <Slower> so yeah
21:39:04 <sdake> #info zaneb close to having a provision + integration test toolset working
21:39:25 <Slower> as some of you know I had a discussion with vishy on #openstack-dev about using a 'heat' user to do operations
21:39:43 <Slower> he pointed out that we would lose quota and billing info
21:39:58 <Slower> and that he thought it'd be better to stick with storing creds for now
21:40:17 <Slower> so I am presently working on just moving the db to do per-tenant keying and then encrypting the creds in the db
21:40:28 <Slower> I also just spoke with adam young who is working on keystone
21:40:33 <Slower> he had some ideas for how to make this work better
21:40:34 <asalkeld> keystone needs "su"
21:40:37 <Slower> yeah :)
21:40:46 <Slower> that's what I said.. he didn't like that as much though
21:40:52 <Slower> he wanted to do signed operations
21:41:07 <asalkeld> sounds fancy
21:41:10 <Slower> so you could sign some operations with the users creds when you had them
21:41:15 <sdake> sounds complicated to me ;)
21:41:16 <Slower> and then use those at a later time
21:41:19 <Slower> yes it does
21:41:25 <Slower> I need to talk to him more
21:41:43 <Slower> but he did have a good point re the user might not being valid at a later date, and that causing ha to fail
21:41:46 <sdake> well i suggest not overcomplicating things, especially around security
21:41:57 <Slower> yeah
21:42:08 <Slower> I talked to him about my concerns with security in openstack/keystone
21:42:22 <Slower> which it turns out are valid.. :)
21:42:38 <sdake> so summary is "work ongoing" :)?
21:42:39 <Slower> so I'm not sure why 'su' is frowned upon.. :)
21:42:44 <Slower> sdake: exactly, yes :)
21:42:56 <Slower> but we will have per-tenant stacks and encrypted creds for v5
21:43:00 <sdake> #info security work ongoing
21:43:08 <sdake> #info will have per-tenant stacks in v5
21:43:13 <sdake> cool
21:43:23 <sdake> asalkeld made the autoscaling magic work?
21:43:31 <asalkeld> ya seems to work
21:43:48 <asalkeld> scales up and down as advertised
21:43:53 <sdake> nice work
21:44:00 <asalkeld> loadbalancer seems to work
21:44:11 <asalkeld> haven't stressed the lb
21:44:11 <sdake> come with a wiki page?
21:44:18 <asalkeld> can do
21:44:22 <sdake> thanks bro
21:44:32 <sdake> #action asalkeld to make wiki page about autoscaling usage
21:44:40 <sdake> #undo
21:44:40 <mheat-bot> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.items.Action object at 0x7fe970fb2390>
21:44:49 <sdake> #action asalkeld to make howto regarding autoscaling
21:44:57 <asalkeld> lb still only does http
21:45:04 <sdake> should be ok
21:45:10 <asalkeld> but can add features as needed
21:45:30 <sdake> few updates from me
21:45:48 <sdake> I've been making a go at matching our paste pipeline to how nova does things
21:46:02 <sdake> more work needed there
21:46:24 <sdake> #info autoscaling working well with loadbalancer nested stack
21:46:48 <sdake> also been taking a crack at adding heat to devstack
21:47:07 <sdake> dont think either will make v5
21:47:19 <sdake> well, some of the paste will but wont be complete
21:47:29 <sdake> any questions
21:47:41 <asalkeld> sounds good
21:47:49 <sdake> shardy any updates?
21:48:00 <shardy> Yep - I added UpdateStack last week
21:48:06 <sdake> nice work
21:48:13 <shardy> but with a default delete/replace logic for resources
21:48:19 <sdake> #info UpdateStack added to master
21:48:38 <shardy> so each resource now has a handle_update method where we need to add non-disruptive update logic
21:48:43 <Slower> shardy: it only delete/replaces those things that changed?
21:49:13 <zaneb> Slower: that's a TODO ;)
21:49:17 <shardy> Slower: yes, exactly, it compares the parsed templates per-resource
21:49:28 <Slower> shardy: cool
21:49:47 <shardy> but if people have detailed knowledge of specific resources, help with getting non-disruptive updates working in due course would be great :)
21:50:13 <shardy> In many cases the correct behavior is to delete/replace anyway so it's a reasonable default approach
21:51:25 <sdake> ok I think that is everyone
21:51:37 <sdake> #topic v5 release
21:51:56 <sdake> For some reason last week, I said we had two weeks to do v5, but it was actually one week
21:52:09 <sdake> so I took liberty of moving it out a week to the 30th
21:52:31 <sdake> this should give us a bit of time to sort out remaining bugs
21:52:55 <sdake> any feature anyone working on not making v5? (1 week)?
21:54:15 <shardy> sdake: I marked CloudWatch API as v5, but I think it's going to be in the next cycle - I did UpdateStack instead
21:54:35 <sdake> shardy ok, can you modify the bug and just untag it from a milestone?
21:54:42 <shardy> sdake: will do
21:54:58 <sdake> ok need to choose a release manager for v5
21:55:08 <sdake> zaneb will be on vacation
21:55:28 <shadower> I can do it
21:55:30 <sdake> possible victims include asalkeld, shardy, jpeeler
21:55:41 <asalkeld> nix
21:55:44 <sdake> haha
21:55:46 <shadower> nevermind then
21:55:51 <shadower> :-)
21:55:58 <sdake> sorry and shadower
21:56:15 <sdake> #info release manager choices include asalkeld, shadower, shardy, jpeeler
21:56:40 <sdake> asalkeld, release manager going to catch up to you ;)
21:57:08 <asalkeld> probably
21:57:12 <sdake> any on that list would like to manage the v5 release?
21:57:21 <sdake> at most 4 more releases ;)
21:57:28 <asalkeld> just choose and shoot
21:57:43 <sdake> any volunteer
21:57:45 <jpeeler> i can do it
21:57:52 <sdake> jpeeler volunteers
21:57:53 <sdake> any others
21:58:02 <shadower> me
21:58:08 <sdake> shadower volunteers
21:58:36 <shardy> I'm happy to do it, but am on PTO from the 3rd
21:58:50 <sdake> probably easiest way to choose is to see if you have critical work over next week that would be interrupted on monday/tu of next week
21:58:57 <sdake> jpeeler got anything cooking?
21:59:02 <sdake> shadower got anything cooking?
21:59:05 <shadower> nope
21:59:18 <Slower> oh yes I'm off next week if that matters
21:59:29 <sdake> no problem slower
21:59:33 <sdake> you already did release manager
21:59:48 <Slower> ya
21:59:49 <sdake> just a reminder, each contributor release manager for a release until everyone used up, then we start a new :)
21:59:53 <Slower> it was terrible
21:59:58 <Slower> ;-)
22:00:01 <sdake> your internet fired imo :)
22:00:03 <shadower> Slower: thanks
22:00:07 <Slower> haha
22:00:17 <Slower> j/k
22:00:32 <sdake> jpeeler - any thoughts on upcoming week, especially around monday/tuesday?
22:00:36 <jpeeler> i don't think there's anything time sensitive in my queue
22:00:53 <sdake> fedora reviews wouldn't be impacted?
22:01:15 <sdake> meeting bot needs a coin flipper
22:01:21 <jpeeler> well... they are perfect, remember? maybe should not assume that
22:02:00 <sdake> jpeeler mind waiting until next release, - would like to make sure fedora review etc goes smoothly
22:02:36 <jpeeler> probably for the best
22:02:41 <asalkeld> say I need to help with kids ...
22:02:46 <sdake> #info shadower release manager for v5
22:02:52 <sdake> #info jpeeler release manager for v6
22:02:52 <asalkeld> anything more for me?
22:03:08 <sdake> asalkeld you have any open issues?
22:03:15 <asalkeld> no all good
22:03:18 <sdake> ok
22:03:47 <sdake> so 1 week, please get things wrapped up hopefully by wed-thur of this week to make shadower's job easier ;)
22:04:00 <sdake> shadower feel free to flog the devs to help with testing specific things
22:04:15 <sdake> hopefully v6 we will have some integration testing of our templates in an automated way
22:04:29 <sdake> #topic open items
22:04:53 <sdake> any open issues?
22:05:00 <sdake> eventlet?
22:05:08 <shadower> that's closed :-)
22:05:27 <shadower> we have a new maintainer now, a new \release has been promissed in a week
22:05:55 <shardy> boto upstream have been unresponsive recently, so I think we need to maintain our current client for the time being
22:05:59 <sdake> #info eventlet has new maintainer with new release planned in the next week
22:06:21 <sdake> #info boto upstream a bit unresponsive - may need to maintain heat client for longer period of time
22:07:27 <sdake> ok if nothing else, I'll end the meeting and post the minutes
22:07:48 <sdake> #endmeeting
