21:06:02 <sdake> #agreed agenda rollcall, blocking bugs, release today, release notes bikeshed session, roadmap v5
21:06:06 <sdake> #topic rollcall
21:06:08 <sdake> sdake here
21:06:13 <zaneb> yo
21:06:14 <Slower> Ian here
21:06:14 <shardy> shardy here
21:06:18 <asalkeld> asalkeld, here
21:06:26 <jpeeler> jpeeler here
21:06:43 <sdake> #topic blocking bugs
21:07:41 <sdake> not sure if this is blocking, but https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=835019
21:07:53 <sdake> can work around with an oz fork
21:08:27 <sdake> results in u10/u12 not starting on fedora hosts
21:09:22 <sdake> #action sdake to make oz fork to work around u10/u12 not starting
21:09:40 <sdake> any other blocking issues people are concerned with (especially those that block the release)
21:10:02 <zaneb> sdake: do you have to fork oz, or could it be resolved by using the oz api?
21:10:10 <sdake> must fork
21:10:14 <zaneb> i.e. import from Python and monkey-patch
21:10:29 <zaneb> ok
21:10:40 <sdake> http://fpaste.org/V8V9/
21:10:54 <asalkeld> this would be good https://github.com/heat-api/heat/issues/145
21:11:07 <asalkeld> not sure if it blocks tho'
21:11:32 <sdake> deb installer makes a logical partition, and kernel.org blocks forever
21:12:15 <sdake> doesn't seem to block us too much
21:12:45 <asalkeld> (ok, just lb work then)
21:12:46 <Slower> The Getting Started guide for fedora needs to mention f17
21:12:46 <zaneb> community will likely be fedora on fedora or ubuntu on ubuntu
21:12:47 <sdake> guess blocks autoscaling
21:12:56 <Slower> I can fix that before release
21:13:14 <Slower> oh also should we be starting the heat-metadata service in the guides?
21:13:20 <sdake> #action slower to submit a review request to update getting started guide to mention fedora 17
21:13:56 <sdake> #action release today
21:13:58 <sdake> #undo
21:13:58 <mheat-bot> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.items.Action object at 0x2589e50>
21:14:01 <sdake> #topic release today
21:14:26 <asalkeld> lets do it
21:14:26 <sdake> everyone have a quick look at the release guide
21:14:28 <sdake> https://github.com/heat-api/heat/wiki/Release-Process
21:14:42 <sdake> specifically the release criteria section
21:14:54 <Slower> 'Launch the Heat services'
21:14:55 <Slower> sudo -E bash -c 'heat-api & heat-engine &'
21:15:45 <sdake> The Getting Started Guide followed from start to finish operates properly.
21:15:45 <sdake> The HA Howto followed from start to finish operates properly.
21:15:46 <sdake> All templates without deb in their name run properly on F16 and F17.
21:15:46 <sdake> All templates with deb in their name run properly on U10 and U12.
21:15:46 <sdake> Validate the HA template using F16 guests by following the HA Howto.
21:16:18 <sdake> any objections to that release criteria?
21:16:24 <sdake> we have been slowly ramping these up every release
21:16:42 <asalkeld> my system misbehaving atm
21:16:53 <asalkeld> I havn't tested all that
21:16:56 <Slower> I agree with the criteria for sure
21:17:02 <Slower> but I haven't tested it all yet either
21:17:08 <Slower> hwoever I intend to before the day is out :)
21:17:11 <asalkeld> ha worked last I ran it
21:17:32 <sdake> zaneb jpeeler?
21:17:37 <zaneb> +1
21:17:46 <jpeeler> yep, sounds good
21:17:48 <shardy> +1
21:17:56 <sdake> oops and shardy forget your in our timezone now :)
21:18:14 <shardy> sdake: np ;)
21:18:33 <sdake> ok, here is what i suggest, since angus not 100% positive on ha, we may want to remove that from the release criteria if we run into trouble
21:18:39 <Slower> I feel like I'm behind on the release engineering business but hopefully it will all work out
21:18:48 <sdake> especially since he wont be able to debug
21:18:51 <sdake> but, lets play it by ear
21:19:07 <asalkeld> well someone could run through it
21:19:22 <asalkeld> and I'll hopefully get functional today
21:19:43 <sdake> i am also going to give one last go at the u12 getting started guide
21:20:22 <sdake> goal is to announce the release tuesday 10PM PST
21:20:37 <sdake> 10AM PST
21:20:47 <sdake> brain malfunction today
21:21:19 <sdake> ok, if everyone happy with release criteria we can revisit it next release
21:21:32 <sdake> and see if we need to add more
21:21:56 <sdake> #agreed release criteria on wiki approved by devs
21:22:35 <sdake> #topic release announce/notes bikeshed
21:22:46 <sdake> slower can you post the current draft
21:23:07 <Slower> sure
21:24:01 <Slower> http://fpaste.org/K4ZJ/
21:24:49 <sdake> line 12 "or try"
21:25:48 <Slower> ok
21:25:52 <Slower> how about 'or on'
21:25:58 <sdake> yes
21:26:17 <Slower> anyone have any smaller things they want to add?
21:26:20 <jpeeler> perhaps the repo should be listed for heat-jeos
21:26:36 <sdake> I think we want to double highlight ubuntu 12 host support and quickstart guide
21:26:44 <Slower> good idea
21:26:58 <asalkeld> Add cfn-push-stats, this can post statistics and service fails to heat. Heat can then escalate the vm service failure to an instance restart
21:27:07 <sdake> "The Heat developers are pleased to announce the release of Heat API version 4.  We have added several features as well as Ubuntu Precise host support."
21:27:42 <sdake> shardy have any suggestions for the release notes?
21:27:52 <sdake> zaneb?
21:27:54 <sdake> asalkeld?
21:27:55 <sdake> jpeeler?
21:27:58 <shardy> sdake: Looks good to me - API rework mentioned
21:28:12 <asalkeld> I did post a comment
21:28:19 <asalkeld> re: ha
21:28:31 <sdake> ya got it, must be lag
21:28:31 <Slower> + Added cfn-push-stats.  This can post statistics and service failure  notifications to heat.  Heat can then escalate the VM service failure to an instance restart.
21:28:32 <jpeeler> aside from what i said about heat-jeos, i think it's good now
21:28:32 <zaneb> looks good to me
21:28:48 <asalkeld> +1
21:28:55 <sdake> paste latest update
21:29:04 <Slower> sec, will add Ubuntu part
21:30:07 <Slower> http://fpaste.org/NYZu/
21:30:33 <sdake> should be Ubuntu precise support
21:30:38 <sdake> we dont want to support u10 for example ;)
21:30:41 <Slower> oh forgot heat-jeos repo
21:30:48 <Slower> precise ?
21:30:54 <Slower> what does that mean?  sorry ubuntu noob :)
21:30:54 <sdake> Precise = 12.04
21:30:56 <sdake> codename
21:30:58 <Slower> ah ok
21:31:22 <asalkeld> Slower, my comment?
21:31:39 <sdake> asalkeld = teflon
21:31:53 <asalkeld> huh?
21:31:59 <sdake> ask lon, inside joke
21:32:03 <asalkeld> at the bottom
21:32:06 <Slower> asalkeld: which comment?
21:32:06 <sdake> sorry i thought you kne w:)
21:32:16 <asalkeld> merge with HA
21:32:46 <Slower> asalkeld: sorry, where is the comment? :)
21:32:47 <asalkeld> o, not an issue just ship
21:33:00 * Slower must be slow
21:33:07 <sdake> (er)
21:33:09 <sdake> need more minerals
21:33:57 <Slower> asalkeld: you wanted the cfn-push-stats part merged with HA bullet?
21:34:05 <asalkeld> yip
21:34:32 <Slower> http://fpaste.org/rAW7/
21:34:40 <Slower> ok I can do that
21:34:40 <sdake> i had one last thought, could you move 42-45 in place of 30
21:34:58 <sdake> ie: move nested stack up above ia:m::user
21:35:09 <Slower> ok
21:35:44 <Slower> asalkeld: I dunno, cfn-push-stats and the HA part are really the same thing..
21:36:01 <Slower> asalkeld: not sure if it's worth going into real detail in the announcement?
21:36:05 <asalkeld> sure
21:36:07 <sdake> how bout angus writes what he wants for 21-23 tells you what to type in :)
21:36:19 <asalkeld> just ship
21:36:23 <sdake> its a critical feature
21:36:45 <Slower> + Cloud Watch high availability. Heat monitors services and VMs and can restart them or send alarms on failure.  Also supported is escalation of service failure can result in an instance restart.  This is similar to the AWS CloudWatch functionality.
21:36:49 <Slower> ?
21:36:52 <asalkeld> Slower, I'll send you something
21:37:01 <asalkeld> after meeting
21:37:14 <asalkeld> brain not working - too early
21:37:27 <sdake> #action asalkeld to send slower details about what should be in lcoud watch high availability section
21:37:30 <Slower> sure
21:37:35 <Slower> :) understood :)
21:37:36 <sdake> sorry about that asalkeld, I wrote what I thought was ok :)
21:37:50 <asalkeld> no worries
21:38:02 <sdake> propose approve release notes including what asalkeld changes :)
21:38:05 <sdake> +1
21:38:07 <Slower> +1
21:38:10 <asalkeld> +1
21:38:11 <shardy> +1
21:38:18 <zaneb> +1
21:38:31 <sdake> jpeeler?
21:39:14 <sdake> well I assume he agrees ;)
21:39:15 <jpeeler> +1
21:39:22 <sdake> #agreed release notes approved
21:39:27 <Slower> you assumed correctly :()
21:39:50 <sdake> #topic roadmap v4

21:39:54 <mheat-bot> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.items.Topic object at 0x2589c10>
21:40:09 <sdake> #topic roadmap v5
21:40:24 <sdake> functional testing
21:41:21 <Slower> per-tenant stacks instead of per-user?
21:41:33 <sdake> brainstorm
21:41:38 <Slower> as per our discussions on list
21:41:55 <shardy> finish AWS API alignment, boto integration
21:42:06 <Slower> that may have some odd side effects though, and could be a bigger project.. eg we may need to develop a heat security policy.json like nova has
21:42:33 <sdake> asalkeld HA sorted out?
21:42:44 <asalkeld> ja I think so
21:42:52 <asalkeld> could do vm health checks
21:43:02 <asalkeld> (extra feature)
21:43:03 <sdake> would be handy
21:43:15 <asalkeld> can do that any time tho'
21:43:24 <asalkeld> busy on lb atm
21:43:25 <sdake> once we wrap up a roadmap feature suggest we mark it as completed
21:43:28 <zaneb> #145/#151 (have metadata server reference stacks by id)
21:43:44 <asalkeld> +1
21:44:11 <sdake> i'd like to see heat-jeos beat into submission
21:44:42 <sdake> Heat fedora 17 package approval
21:44:44 <asalkeld> also I'de like to see cfn capable of been installed via github
21:44:49 <Slower> stacks should be key'd differently (not by name) so that we can have multiple stacks with the same name in a different tenant or different user (depending)
21:45:02 <asalkeld> not needed to be pre-baked
21:45:16 <shardy> Do we currently track AWS capabilities used by and allowed in stacks?
21:45:34 <Slower> right that's the same bug
21:45:40 <Slower> #151
21:45:44 <sdake> Heat PPA + oz PPA
21:46:02 <Slower> PPA?
21:46:12 <sdake> like a yum repo but for anyone to setup and access
21:46:23 <Slower> ah ok
21:46:28 <sdake> for ubuntu
21:46:35 <asalkeld> private package archive?
21:46:47 <sdake> probably what it means but tbh not sure ;)
21:46:53 <sdake> i think it may be personal actually
21:47:03 <zaneb> yeah, personal
21:47:14 <sdake> anything else?
21:47:24 <asalkeld> lb + autoscale
21:47:40 <asalkeld> needs #151
21:47:57 <sdake> sounds like blocker to me, zaneb can you fix
21:48:06 <zaneb> yep, working on it already
21:48:10 <sdake> cool
21:48:26 <sdake> last call
21:49:01 <sdake> ok well thats a ton of stuff, lets see what we can get wrapped up in 3-4 weeks
21:49:08 <sdake> can discuss again at next meeting
21:49:26 <sdake> looks like dev slowing down a bit - because code base becoming more complete
21:49:40 <asalkeld> (more to break)
21:49:47 <sdake> haha precisely
21:50:16 <asalkeld> need functional tests
21:50:32 <sdake> i suggest devs pick what they want to work on, file a bug, and assign it to themselves so others know your working on it
21:50:37 <sdake> ya functional tests already mentioned
21:50:50 <sdake> zaneb+sdake going to be cranking on that as soon as your unblocked asalkeld
21:50:59 <asalkeld> cool
21:51:03 <sdake> manual acceptance criteria sucks
21:51:26 <asalkeld> just good to have those running dayly
21:51:30 <sdake> release should be "can we make release notes"
21:51:41 <zaneb> so, at this point it might be time for my plug that the getting startde guide is fully automated :)
21:52:00 <asalkeld> well done
21:52:10 <sdake> yup nice work now for ubuntu version :)
21:52:31 <sdake> #topic open items
21:52:31 <zaneb> once I get F17 running on the test server we'll even know if it works ;)
21:53:33 <sdake> if it is still your work day, do what you can to help slower get the release out
21:53:36 <sdake> so we can move on to next work
21:53:52 <sdake> by fixing bugs etc
21:54:32 <sdake> asalkeld I updated the ha guide
21:54:34 <sdake> https://github.com/heat-api/heat/wiki/Using-HA
21:54:35 <Slower> running through getting started guide, testing ha
21:54:50 <sdake> can you have a look and make sure it is still correct
21:54:52 <Slower> I'm going to install f17 and test on that
21:55:04 <asalkeld> sure
21:55:16 <sdake> I think there is something missing there about the iptables rules
21:55:28 <asalkeld> where?
21:55:33 <asalkeld> ha?
21:55:35 <sdake> #action asalkeld review ha guide
21:55:46 <sdake> ya, doesn't a port need to be opened?
21:55:54 <asalkeld> I don't change any iptables rules
21:56:18 <asalkeld> might need to configure metadata bind ip
21:56:20 <sdake> couple people have had to do so, I've been up to my neck in ubuntu and oz haven't had a chance to test that yet
21:56:36 <zaneb> iirc that was required for all metadata
21:56:53 <zaneb> that is to say, for anything involving the metadata server
21:56:54 <asalkeld> yip
21:57:03 <sdake> don't see in docs
21:57:14 <asalkeld> what docs
21:57:20 <sdake> the wiki docs
21:57:28 <asalkeld> ya missing
21:57:37 <sdake> okie
21:57:37 <zaneb> yeah, metadata documentation is MIA
21:57:53 <sdake> sounds like we need metadata documentation
21:58:06 <Slower> agreed
21:58:06 <asalkeld> well a line or two
21:58:13 <asalkeld> will do fine
21:58:16 <sdake> anyone that knows how to configure metadata server mind writing a wiki
21:58:21 <sdake> or adding to ha
21:58:29 <asalkeld> I'll add to ha
21:58:40 <sdake> #action asalkeld to add metadata config info to ha guide
21:58:49 <sdake> ok guys anything else?
21:59:02 <asalkeld> nope
21:59:12 <zaneb> no
21:59:45 <sdake> ok thanks for coming - lets get this release knocked out today then and move on to next dev :)
21:59:47 <sdake> #endmeeting
