21:00:18 <mheat-bot`> Current chairs: Slower asalkeld blomquisg funzo jpeeler pmyers sdake shadower shardy zaneb
21:00:44 <Slower> sdake: awesome job on the demo btw
21:00:46 <funzo> ok, meeting in session, let's quickly agree on anything that needs to be discussed via agenda
21:00:55 <funzo> sdak:++
21:01:19 <shardy> Hi all
21:01:25 <funzo> proposals for items that need irc meeting coordination:
21:01:27 <funzo> go.
21:01:36 <funzo> 1) community facing stuffs
21:01:42 <Slower> haha
21:01:45 <funzo> 2) any blockers that need help from others
21:01:51 <Slower> well, specifically I think:
21:02:06 <Slower> - are we ready to push this out to the public (more release announcements etc)
21:02:10 <funzo> 3) timeline for end of milestone
21:02:21 <Slower> - do we need more docs?  more example templates? etc to make it easier for users to get started
21:02:30 <funzo> Slower: sdake sent out an email to the list as an announcement
21:02:48 <funzo> any other items folks want to coordinate so we can get started?
21:02:53 <Slower> only to our list tho right?  It could go to openstack lists too I would think (for example)
21:03:04 <Slower> but we should wait to talk about it :)
21:03:04 <funzo> ya
21:03:21 <funzo> all agreed on the agenda?
21:03:31 <Slower> +1
21:03:42 <asalkeld> Slower, https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg10478.html
21:03:43 <sdake> sec
21:04:07 <Slower> ok awesome
21:04:08 <sdake> high availability work
21:04:27 <funzo> sdake: status, or stuff that needs to be done
21:04:44 <sdake> status
21:04:49 <asalkeld> ok
21:04:52 <sdake> in fact status for all roadmap items :)
21:05:02 <asalkeld> so done cfn-hup
21:05:11 <sdake> wait asalkeld not on agenda item yet :)
21:05:19 <asalkeld> o
21:05:31 <funzo> so, let's do that now then?
21:05:38 <sdake> sounds good
21:05:40 <funzo> #topic status for roadmap items
21:05:52 <funzo> I'll go first on the unit test framework, ok?
21:05:57 <sdake> yup
21:05:59 <Slower> please do :)
21:06:17 <funzo> the python-novaclient test src has been copied into our tree, so no more PYTHON_NOVA_SRC env variable needed
21:06:32 <funzo> a reference imple using the mock framework is displayed in the test_resources.py
21:06:39 <funzo> I am currently working on the stacks tests
21:07:10 <funzo> jpeeler has been working on the jeos create tests, we worked around a venv issue today
21:07:21 <funzo> we are now able to skip any includes that are not available in pip
21:07:36 <jpeeler> yeah the email i sent to the mailing list is still relevant i think
21:07:40 <funzo> that should give us the ability to run all the tests in a virtual env
21:07:58 <funzo> jpeeler: which part?
21:08:06 <funzo> http://lists.heat-api.org/pipermail/discuss/2012-April/000062.html
21:08:16 <sdake> jpeeler use #link
21:08:24 <jpeeler> not the problem part, just the part to keep the venv dependencies up to date
21:08:27 <funzo> I think it will pick it up without #link
21:08:32 <sdake> ok
21:08:42 <jpeeler> and try to use stuff in pip
21:09:00 <funzo> one thing to note is that virtualenv has seen this problem before
21:09:21 <funzo> they implemented a switch to fall back to system site-packages, but that also defeats the purpose of a virtual env
21:09:34 <funzo> for our scope, I would think we would not yak shave on the topic and just use the SkipTest plugin shipped with nose
21:09:54 <funzo> and then when we don't need to run a virtualenv we use --no-skip-tests
21:10:07 <funzo> that was we have coverage and we can use only a pip based virtual env
21:10:14 <funzo> not to rat hole on this, but we have bigger fish to fry
21:10:24 <funzo> so, anyway that is my roadmap update
21:10:28 <asalkeld> HA: done cfn-hup (and restarting services), shadower started on metadata server. still got work in metadata server, cfn-signal and the last bit in heat-engine
21:10:30 <funzo> we can continue the discussion on the list
21:10:47 <sdake> lol asalakled
21:10:49 <funzo> asalkeld: and I saw you merged it to master
21:10:51 <sdake> one last  thing on testing
21:11:12 <sdake> zane are you about wrapped up with the quickstart auto test
21:11:24 <zaneb> couple more days probably
21:11:35 <sdake> cool i got couple days to get a machine rolling for you then ;)
21:11:36 <zaneb> also, Tuesday is a holiday here
21:11:38 <sdake> ok
21:11:43 <sdake> we are using lvm model then?
21:11:47 <zaneb> so I'm thinking, end of this week
21:11:59 <zaneb> maybe, or maybe I can get it running in a VM
21:12:11 <sdake> ok well let me know as soon as you know
21:12:15 <zaneb> ok
21:12:24 <sdake> so i can start work on lvmism if needed
21:12:33 <sdake> ok now asalkeld :)
21:12:39 <asalkeld> I am done
21:12:41 <funzo> when should we target moving to stackforge infra?
21:13:00 <sdake> i think we need to extend this dev cycle a week
21:13:00 <asalkeld> today?
21:13:03 <sdake> we had talked end of week
21:13:12 <funzo> kk
21:13:13 <sdake> we have a few things to get setup
21:13:24 <sdake> and i dont htink its going to be ready this week
21:13:39 <sdake> we have to get a tox.ini file that describes the deps
21:14:13 <funzo> I'll extend the versions end date in github by a week then
21:14:36 <funzo> #action funzo update the github version dates (extend a week)
21:15:21 <funzo> k, is that all the currently in flight roadmap items?
21:15:39 <sdake> no, also have the parity
21:15:53 <sdake> so regarding that, zane was going to make a table out of the partiy doc i think
21:15:59 <zaneb> yep
21:16:12 <sdake> then asalkled, shadower, sdake can correct ?
21:16:21 <zaneb> yeah, that would be ideal
21:16:32 <zaneb> I'm sure there's some stuff I will have missed in the code
21:16:34 <sdake> anyone else implement any resource types?
21:16:47 <funzo> I haven't, but I would like to get into that part
21:16:49 <funzo> so, can help
21:16:51 <asalkeld> zaneb, looks good
21:16:57 <Slower> want an update on the associate users with templates item?
21:17:06 <asalkeld> need IAM::user
21:17:11 <sdake> #action zane to tableize the parity doc
21:17:25 <zaneb> we also need to decide on how much of the unimplemented stuff we want to implement
21:17:31 <sdake> #action asalkled, sdake, shadower, funzo to validate parity table
21:17:47 <sdake> zaneb tbh i think that could take an entire agenda meeting and then some ;)
21:17:54 <zaneb> lol
21:18:05 <funzo> we might want to refactory the resources.py as it will become enourmous over time
21:18:18 <Slower> well and it all takes time right?  We could basically just pick away at it and see how it goes :)
21:18:39 <zaneb> funzo: that's easy enough to do though
21:18:42 <funzo> ya
21:18:42 <sdake> asalkeld had idea of making milestones based upon certain template support
21:19:01 <funzo> I like that idea
21:19:07 <sdake> i do too
21:19:12 <asalkeld> so get template X running perfectly
21:19:24 <Slower> well I suspect we will often have infrastructure items too
21:19:26 <funzo> k, then we need to choose some templates
21:19:37 <funzo> pick a top three, or something
21:19:48 <asalkeld> what is the simplest
21:20:05 <Slower> sounds good tho ya
21:20:22 <funzo> discuss that on list?
21:20:28 <sdake> ya discuss on list
21:20:37 <funzo> #funzo start thread for template choices
21:20:49 <sdake> i think you need a #action :)
21:20:53 <funzo> lol
21:20:59 <funzo> yeah that
21:21:07 <funzo> #action funzo start thread for template choices
21:21:31 <asalkeld> here is one for funzo https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/IAM_Users_Groups_and_Policies.template
21:21:52 <funzo> kk
21:22:04 <funzo> any other roadmap updates?
21:22:08 <sdake> security
21:22:24 <funzo> Slower: ready to continue?
21:22:27 <sdake> jpeeler, slower?
21:22:37 <Slower> Yeah I did a bunch of code reading and learning about keystone
21:22:46 <Slower> my findings are all up on the wiki
21:23:05 <sdake> #action all review security roadmap item
21:23:16 <funzo> https://github.com/heat-api/heat/wiki/Roadmap-Feature:-Associate-users-with-templates-using-keystone
21:23:21 <jpeeler> i haven't investigated yet, but it seems Slower has left for me to do the database changes
21:23:24 <sdake> we can discuss on list then
21:23:26 <Slower> but I did find a few security issues, how to deal with AWS style access keys, and how to work the code to get the username
21:23:37 <Slower> still have to look at the database and how that will work
21:24:01 <funzo> kk
21:24:34 <funzo> sdake: you reminded me of something during the demo, if you guys know about bugs that you need others to look into, please create and issue on github and assign it to the dev
21:24:45 <sdake> i think i did for that bug
21:24:50 <sdake> but need to double check
21:24:59 <funzo> ok
21:25:03 <funzo> any other updates
21:25:13 <sdake> there is like 40 issues on the issue tracker brain can't hold that many items at one time :)
21:25:18 <shardy> I started looking into boto re #92
21:25:49 <shardy> I think it expects ec2 style auth, so may have to work that out first
21:26:17 <asalkeld> shardy, you need to work with Slower
21:26:21 <funzo> ok next agenda item was to review any blocking issues that require group thought, or do you want to wait on that one?
21:26:31 <funzo> that stuff might go on forever
21:26:39 <sdake> ya lets delay to end
21:26:41 <shardy> asalkeld: Cool, will do, any pointers appreciated :)
21:26:45 <Slower> shardy: ya I looked into it
21:27:04 <funzo> community stuffs?
21:27:10 <Slower> shardy: doesn't look to hard actually
21:27:20 <sdake> sdake working on learning how to make videos
21:27:25 <Slower> keystone does the translation iirc, you just have to check what kind of creds it's using
21:27:27 <sdake> funzo had idea to create vids for each dev
21:27:29 <Slower> anyway ping me after if you want
21:27:33 <funzo> #topic community content
21:27:36 <sdake> change agenda item
21:27:51 <funzo> sdake: I talked to some of you about making a 30 second or less intro video, but didn't get a hold of everyone
21:27:58 <funzo> I'll send an internal email to everyone
21:28:01 <Slower> so basically I wanted us to discuss ideas to get more community involvement
21:28:13 <funzo> sdake: to what
21:28:15 <asalkeld> funzo, I'll get there planning a hair was soon ;)
21:28:19 <Slower> well I think a demo video would be a better idea
21:28:21 <asalkeld> funzo, I'll get there planning a hair wash soon ;)
21:28:29 <funzo> haha
21:28:31 <sdake> haha asalkeld showers ftw
21:28:42 <Slower> haha
21:28:51 <funzo> k, logo?
21:29:01 <sdake> slower ya two videos, one demo one getting started
21:29:02 <funzo> are we all agreed on the logo Slower sent out?
21:29:08 <Slower> sdake: yes that would be good
21:29:14 <asalkeld> ya, good
21:29:18 <sdake> propose logo slower sent out +/-
21:29:19 <sdake> +
21:29:19 <funzo> I'm cool with it too
21:29:23 <funzo> +
21:29:25 <Slower> http://stemwinder.org/heat14.png
21:29:26 <zaneb> +1
21:29:28 <asalkeld> can always tweek as time goes by
21:29:32 <Slower> yes
21:29:42 <sdake> logo goes on your permanent record ;)
21:29:45 <shardy> +1
21:29:49 <Slower> I think probably the basic flame as the identifier of the project.. text etc can be changed
21:30:02 <Slower> size, color all that
21:30:02 <asalkeld> +1
21:30:20 <funzo> ok, need to talk to the libvirt guys about what sort of trademarking they did
21:30:20 <sdake> #action slower to check in svg of logo to website repo
21:30:21 <Slower> +1
21:30:27 <Slower> ok
21:30:57 <funzo> Slower: anything else you want to talk about for community stuff
21:31:33 <Slower> well, does anyone else have any ideas on how to get more community involvement
21:31:35 <Slower> ?
21:31:35 <sdake> logo + vids should keep us busy there for a week
21:31:41 <funzo> kk
21:32:07 <asalkeld> do we need to reach out to other related projects?
21:32:09 <funzo> #action send out email for personal intro video for consistent script and video length
21:32:21 <Slower> sdake: what about posting to umm, the HA guys list?
21:32:26 <Slower> pacemaker :)
21:32:27 <Slower> hehe
21:32:42 <funzo> #action funzo send out email for personal intro video for consistent script and video length
21:32:45 <sdake> ya i'll spam those lists
21:32:51 <Slower> maybe when we get a release with HA in it?
21:32:55 <asalkeld> ya
21:33:09 <sdake> ya lets wait until ha is solidified
21:33:22 <sdake> atm heat melting the chocolate
21:33:34 <asalkeld> yum
21:33:40 <asalkeld> hot choc
21:33:56 <funzo> ok, move on to blockers that need group thought?
21:34:11 <sdake> ya blockers
21:34:14 <funzo> #topic discuss blocker dev issues that need group thought
21:34:26 <sdake> anything blocking in testing?
21:34:40 <sdake> the ini file
21:34:44 <funzo> we had that venv issue, but I think we can get past that now
21:34:50 <funzo> ..not optimal but ok I think
21:35:06 <funzo> who's working on the ini thing, sdake you?
21:35:14 <sdake> pretty overloaded atm
21:35:21 <funzo> sdake I can help out with that
21:35:22 <sdake> think someone else needs to take it
21:35:30 <sdake> jpeeler might have bandwidth
21:35:31 <funzo> just need to jump in and see what the issue is
21:35:43 <funzo> jpeeler: do you want to look into it?
21:35:55 <funzo> that is a precursor to using stackforge, right?
21:35:59 <sdake> yup
21:36:09 <jpeeler> the ini file?
21:36:15 <funzo> jpeeler: tox.ini
21:36:18 <funzo> it describes the deps
21:36:26 <sdake> link?
21:36:42 <funzo> http://code.google.com/p/pytox/source/browse/tox.ini
21:36:50 <jpeeler> i can take that on
21:36:53 <funzo> I don't know what all the issues are atm
21:36:55 <sdake> thx
21:37:12 <funzo> #action jpeeler look into getting tox.ini setup to get us into stackforge
21:37:36 <funzo> what else needs group intpu
21:37:56 <sdake> are test cases complete enough to go into stackforge yet?
21:37:58 <sdake> or we need more time there
21:38:16 <funzo> not sure what the guage is there
21:38:19 <sdake> emberassed to say but haven't pulled repo for a week - working on other stuff unfortunately
21:38:27 <funzo> if they pass, they can go in, or is it a certain amount of coverage
21:38:41 <sdake> there is no coverage requirement for related projects
21:38:42 <Slower> push them early if you can
21:38:43 <funzo> there aren't a lot of tests in there
21:38:46 <Slower> then others can help
21:38:53 <funzo> I think we can just get it in there and continue to extend
21:39:00 <asalkeld> +1
21:39:03 <sdake> +1
21:39:06 <funzo> I think coverage is really just going to help us with our modifications over time
21:39:07 <Slower> +1
21:39:35 <funzo> I can work with the openstack infra guys to get it in there, if that helps
21:39:48 <funzo> sdake: is that something you're already doing
21:39:50 <sdake> i can handle that
21:39:54 <funzo> kk
21:40:21 <sdake> once these videos are done my schedule will open up a bit ;)
21:40:45 <funzo> sdake: shall we put a new logo splash screen in the vieo?
21:40:47 <funzo> video
21:40:48 <sdake> working on jenkins for quickstart test too
21:40:53 <funzo> nice
21:40:54 <sdake> sounds good
21:41:03 <sdake> need svg ;)
21:41:14 <funzo> ok, any other technical issues need group input?
21:41:24 <asalkeld> not from me
21:41:34 <funzo> anyone under utilized?
21:41:39 <asalkeld> lol
21:41:42 <sdake> haha
21:41:43 <funzo> :)
21:41:55 <sdake> *everyone steps back from line*
21:41:59 <funzo> haha
21:42:06 <funzo> ok, we can probably end the meeting then
21:42:07 <Slower> haha
21:42:17 <funzo> all in favor?
21:42:23 <sdake> monday monkey ftw
21:42:27 <sdake> +1
21:42:28 <Slower> +1
21:42:31 <asalkeld> +1
21:42:32 <zaneb> +20
