20:59:01 <funzo> did I miss anyone that needs to be a chair?
21:00:17 <funzo> 2) architectural changes in the last week - resource dependency calc and user auth
21:00:38 <funzo> any other items folks want to cover?
21:00:57 <sdake> functional testing
21:00:57 <shadower> how about splitting jeos-create to a standalone tool/package?
21:00:58 <asalkeld> probably ubuntu support
21:00:59 <sdake> packaging
21:01:02 <sdake> jeos split
21:01:46 <funzo> ok, shall we go ahead and start then
21:01:54 <asalkeld> I need to go in 8 min - you want an update?
21:01:59 <funzo> sure
21:02:01 <sdake> yup
21:02:11 <sdake> lets talk about jeos create split next too pls
21:02:16 <funzo> #topic ubuntu support
21:02:30 <sdake> asalkeld has to roll, lets give him an update with cloudwatch
21:02:32 <sdake> #undo
21:02:32 <mheat-bot> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.items.Topic object at 0x24f5f90>
21:02:40 <sdake> #topic cloudwatch roadmap status
21:02:45 <zaneb> evening y'all
21:02:49 <asalkeld> so I have a bunch of commits, and am busy debugging
21:02:49 <sdake> yo zaneb
21:03:15 <asalkeld> will get there, the alarm is causing some problems
21:03:22 <asalkeld> (in the code)
21:03:30 <asalkeld> so just working tho' them
21:04:04 <sdake> ok that it asalkeld?
21:04:11 <asalkeld> also we need https://github.com/heat-api/heat/issues/136 fixed
21:04:23 <asalkeld> causes a mess ^
21:04:29 <asalkeld> (all done)
21:04:37 <sdake> #topic split jeos create into separate repo
21:04:55 <shadower> I have a working prototype done
21:04:56 <asalkeld> cfn + jeos together
21:04:59 <shadower> needs cleanup
21:04:59 <sdake> basic proposal here is for a roadmap item
21:05:21 <sdake> shadower tell us what you have in prototype
21:05:24 <asalkeld> also what about into audrey?
21:06:01 <sdake> audrey doesn't do jeos creation
21:06:02 <shadower> so far it lives in the same repo but doesn't depend on any Heat stuff except for having access to cfntools and tdl directorise
21:06:26 <sdake> what features does it have
21:06:33 <asalkeld> those should all be together
21:06:37 <sdake> create tdl, create image, install image?
21:06:52 <sdake> in the aeolus/audrey model they are not together
21:07:05 <shadower> yeah, all together for now -- like the old jeos-create
21:07:11 <asalkeld> but should be
21:07:24 <sdake> the basic proposal is to put cfn/tdl/imaging tools into one package
21:07:27 <sdake> and one repo
21:07:37 <sdake> so it can be installed separately
21:07:43 <asalkeld> ya
21:08:11 <asalkeld> later guys
21:08:13 <sdake> anyone opposed to this proposal for a roadmap item?
21:08:15 <sdake> later asalkeld
21:08:19 <shadower> see ya
21:08:33 <funzo> #agreed the basic proposal is to put cfn/tdl/imaging tools into one package and one repo
21:08:53 <sdake> shadower since you taken the bulls by the horns
21:08:57 <sdake> mind wrapping that up? :)
21:09:02 <shadower> not at all
21:09:18 <shadower> how would the CI integration work?
21:09:36 <shadower> do we have to do additioal setup
21:09:38 <sdake> i guess not in the short term
21:10:03 <shadower> fair
21:10:23 <sdake> #action shadower create new repo in heat org and put merge jeos code there
21:10:39 <sdake> ok sorry for hijacking there funzo, back to the original agenda - just wnated to get those in before asalkeld rolled out
21:10:50 <funzo> no worries
21:11:17 <shadower> I don't think I have the right to create repos
21:11:21 <shadower> put that as an action item?
21:11:33 <sdake> #action sdake create repo for shadower for jeos tools
21:11:58 <shadower> thx, sorry to derail it even further
21:12:05 <funzo> ok anything else before the roadmap items status?
21:12:19 <sdake> probably what would make most sense is to fork master into a new repo, then delete the stuff out of it so we don't lose the cfn histroies
21:12:52 <funzo> yeah, that would be good
21:12:54 <sdake> roadmap item ubuntu support
21:13:09 <funzo> #topic roadmap item ubuntu support
21:13:11 <sdake> u10 guest launching works + wordpress demo works
21:13:18 <funzo> nice
21:13:41 <sdake> jpeeler will miss this meeting, but he had indicated progress is taking place on ubuntu hos tsupport
21:13:41 <funzo> that it then?
21:13:47 <sdake> we keep the wiki up to date on that
21:13:59 <sdake> #topic roadmap item nested stacks
21:14:26 <sdake> zaneb any updates there
21:14:27 <zaneb> so, I'm working on a series of patch for that atm
21:14:39 <zaneb> some are already delivered
21:14:47 <funzo> zaneb also did a bunch of work on calculating resources deps too
21:15:06 <zaneb> yeah, that is going to be part of it
21:15:36 <zaneb> I'm refactoring a lot of the code as I go to hopefully make it simple to turn a stack into a resource
21:16:02 <funzo> I am having a bit of trouble with the wait conditions with that stuff but I can bother you about it later
21:16:14 <zaneb> ok, cool
21:16:34 <zaneb> I haven't encountered any major obstacles yet
21:16:47 <zaneb> I have a rough idea of what I'm going to try
21:16:48 <funzo> just the HA template
21:17:13 <sdake> #topic template parity support
21:17:20 <funzo> k
21:17:31 <funzo> I created a puppet master using the aws template
21:17:34 <funzo> also created the client
21:17:45 <funzo> the client gets wordpress setup (2 nodes)
21:18:00 <funzo> although, ran into some issues after rebasing, will work with zane on the wait conditions
21:18:20 <funzo> I probably won't finish all the open source application stacks before the release
21:18:31 <funzo> this week will be my last week dedicated to the project
21:18:44 <funzo> end
21:18:58 <sdake> #topic security rework
21:19:20 <sdake> slower any update there
21:19:21 <Slower> So we have auth for ec2 and keystone user/pass working
21:19:32 <Slower> I just tested with a non-admin user and that works
21:19:56 <Slower> so next on the list is to associate stacks with the user in the database
21:20:00 <Slower> I think that shouldn't take too long
21:20:11 <Slower> I also want to check with the openstack devs that I have done all the auth stuff correctly
21:20:48 <Slower> so I would think early next week we should have users associated with stacks
21:20:54 <sdake> nice job slower
21:21:02 <sdake> #topic boto integration
21:21:19 <sdake> shardy_afk are you afk? :)
21:21:47 <Slower> I know the boto commands authenticate properly now :)
21:22:10 <Slower> he has an issue with returning json instead of xml for the calls
21:22:13 <sdake> well we will have to sync with shardy later perhaps ;)
21:22:30 <Slower> there's still a fair bit of work to do there I think
21:22:34 <Slower> I will probably help him some too
21:22:46 <sdake> cool makes a perfect segway after security is done ;)
21:22:51 <Slower> yes :)
21:23:18 <Slower> I have been testing it some already to verify security aspect
21:23:27 <sdake> #topic stackforgeing
21:23:40 <sdake> seems like folks have been doing patch reviews
21:23:53 <sdake> intent was to discuss whether that made sense this week
21:24:05 <sdake> but since folks already doing it, seems like it makes sense
21:24:27 <sdake> just would like to hear anyone doesn't want to do reviews of patches
21:25:08 <funzo> I mean, it's a visual review unless you go through the trouble of downloading the patch and applying it
21:25:09 <sdake> #agreed devs agree to review patches from other devs in stackforge
21:25:17 <sdake> ya visual
21:25:17 <Slower> I didn't really want to but it's been fine
21:25:34 <Slower> we seem to have very high quality work going on here, I don't know that serious reviews are necessary at this stage
21:25:49 <sdake> i have found it a bit helpful so far
21:26:00 <zaneb> I like code reviews
21:26:01 <zaneb> a lot
21:26:03 <Slower> yeah I don't mind the visual reviews we have been doing
21:26:07 <shadower> I'm cool with what we have now
21:26:09 <sdake> caught a few things from going in that would have been broken
21:26:13 <zaneb> but I am not in love with that tool
21:26:24 <sdake> jenkins ?   Future of computing zaneb :)
21:26:30 <Slower> haha
21:26:34 <asalkeld> hi, back
21:26:34 <shadower> guess he means gerrit
21:26:50 <sdake> we will be using jenkins until we are riding off into the sunset :)
21:26:59 <zaneb> the combination of jenkins & gerrit, I guess
21:27:36 <Slower> right because these have a history of never being replaced by the next great thing..
21:27:36 <sdake> #topic packaging update
21:27:47 <zaneb> there's a big delay and then when something else gets merged you have to resubmit + re-review everyhting
21:27:55 <sdake> jpeeler going to do fedora package review and get cracking on PPAs
21:28:56 <sdake> i want to propose we float around the release manager role
21:29:01 <sdake> to a new dev every release
21:29:12 <sdake> that dev does fedora update + PPA update + package release
21:29:48 <funzo> the guide is really quite comprehensive
21:29:57 <funzo> so we should be able to float it pretty easily
21:30:08 <shadower> I've never done any of that so I'd appreciate giving it a try
21:30:58 <funzo> oh, do we need to do releases on all the repos now?
21:31:04 <Slower> sounds good
21:31:11 <sdake> #topic functional testing
21:31:14 <funzo> for instance, the packaging repo isn't being tagged and released at the same cadence
21:31:38 <sdake> #undo
21:31:38 <mheat-bot> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.items.Topic object at 0x256a1d0>
21:31:54 <sdake> funzo not sure, probably need to think about that
21:32:07 <sdake> fedora + ubuntu packaging wont be ready for next release on 16th
21:32:17 <sdake> so we have some time to sort that out
21:32:42 <funzo> kk
21:32:45 <sdake> #topic functional testing
21:33:01 <sdake> zaneb had a chance to try setup of the f17 host on beaker ?
21:34:40 <funzo> he might be gone
21:34:45 <sdake> possible ;)
21:34:53 <funzo> late there
21:34:59 <sdake> was there anything else anyone wanted to cover in the agenda?
21:35:04 <zaneb> still here
21:35:15 <zaneb> I haven't looked at beaker again yet
21:35:40 <funzo> has anyone had issues deleting stacks that use security groups?
21:35:47 <funzo> like multiple node stacks?
21:35:49 <sdake> zaneb i'll setup a f17 host and see if beaker is fixed yet
21:36:00 <zaneb> ok
21:36:12 <zaneb> yeah, if it boots that will be a good start :)
21:36:12 <sdake> i'll take that machine back from you in beaker then
21:36:15 <funzo> ie, security group still being in use
21:36:16 <zaneb> cool
21:36:26 <funzo> I think angus had some ideas
21:36:33 <sdake> funzo haven't seen that, but been only palying with u10 for last week
21:36:34 <funzo> not using a timer, sdake did he convey any of those ideas
21:36:39 <funzo> k
21:36:46 <funzo> we can go over it tomorrow
21:36:51 <funzo> nothing else I wanted to cover
21:36:55 <zaneb> funzo: did that patch of yours to wait for the instance to be deleted work?
21:37:29 <asalkeld> funzo, I just suggested using eventlet timeouts
21:37:40 <asalkeld> not some custom thing
21:37:44 <funzo> ah
21:37:56 <sdake> ya i recall - that looked like the correct way to go
21:38:05 <funzo> ok, I'll look into that then
21:38:20 <funzo> and I'll follow up with zane on the wait condition thing
21:38:28 <zaneb> cool
21:38:35 <zaneb> the wait condition thing has never worked for me
21:38:43 <sdake> #action sdake to install f17 host using beaker if possible now
21:38:57 <asalkeld> zaneb, it needs a new jeos
21:39:06 <sdake> #action funzo to look into eventlets for deleting security groups
21:39:09 <funzo> kk
21:39:13 <asalkeld> (it used to run the userdata twice)
21:39:19 <zaneb> asalkeld: that would probably explain it, thanks
21:39:23 <asalkeld> and send 2 signals
21:39:28 <asalkeld> one good one bad
21:39:31 <funzo> the wait conditions hande url parsing seems to be broken
21:39:36 <sdake> the userdata run twice was fixed without updating the jeos
21:39:49 <asalkeld> ah, on
21:39:51 <sdake> it was in heat/cloudconfig/
21:39:57 <asalkeld> that's right
21:40:27 <zaneb> ok, funzo and I can go through it tomorrow
21:40:33 <funzo> kk
21:40:38 <funzo> that's all I had
21:40:58 <funzo> anyone else?
